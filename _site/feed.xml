In this post, we’ll walk through how to intercept and inspect traffic from a Flutter app running on an Android Virtual Device (AVD) using Frida without requiring root access. This is achieved by modifying the APK to include the Frida runtime. Throughout this guide, I will be using Debian as the host OS.
